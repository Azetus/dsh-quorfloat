//! The session: handshake, liveness, and shutdown.
//!
//! This module owns the *state* of a connection to the Harness host and knows
//! nothing about processes or sockets. Frames arrive through [`FrameSource`] and
//! leave through [`FrameSink`], both of which are small enough to implement with
//! a vector in a test. That is deliberate: the handshake order and the answers to
//! liveness traffic are the parts most likely to be wrong, and they must be
//! verifiable without a host, a model, or a spawned process.
//!
//! Two rules from `docs/protocol.md` shape everything here:
//!
//! - **stdout carries protocol frames and nothing else.** Log lines go to the
//!   sink's `log`, which is stderr. A stray `println!` would corrupt the stream
//!   the host is parsing, so no code in this crate writes to stdout directly.
//! - **The host judges liveness by `ping`, not by `host/heartbeat`.** A peer that
//!   forwarded heartbeats but never answered `ping` would be declared dead while
//!   happily talking, so `ping` is answered before anything else is considered.
